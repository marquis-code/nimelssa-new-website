          Boasting of several notable figures some of which includes;
          • Prof. Kolawole Solomon Oyedeji
          • Prof Akinloye
          • Miss Kate Henshaw.
          In tandem to our versatility, we also organize symposia, outreaches, seminars and training workshops to give
          participants the extra edge a classroom typically would not provide and in an effort to ensure a well-rounded
          organization, just as the saying goes “All work no play makes Jack a dull boy” we host grand electrifying social
          events to help members.

          The University of Lagos is an ecosystem consisting various disciplines and an even wider variety of people. As
          our disciplines are not defined by borders but are all interwoven, every student and staff alike and all who
          interact within this school ecosystem actively participate in our events.

          Although NIMELSSA, as an association, is saddled with the responsibility of catering for the needs and welfare
          of the entire students of the department of Medical Laboratory Science, University of Lagos, but as one of the
          foremost medical student bodies in UNILAG, we have embraced a culture of always giving back to the community.
