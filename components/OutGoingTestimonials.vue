              diverse group one subject holds us together; the study of medical laboratory science. NIMELSSA provided me with opportunities to test several theories I've learned from
              my culture and books. It allowed me to network and to develop new interests. I'm glad I didn't just walk
              through the community but I also served the her through volunteerism, leadership capacity, and supports for
              other students.  I love NIMELSSA and I hope it continually grow and provides a dynamic incubation

                I wouldn't be able to
                build myself to become a better version of who I am today. Now I have millions of reasons not to live for
                myself alone,but to live a life that will positively influence people around me.  My advice to the coming tenure is to set SMART ( Specific, Measurable,
                Attainable, Reliable, and
                Time-bound)
                goals.  My advice to Nimelssaites in general is to always think of how to give back to
                Nimelssa not what to
                always
                benefit from the association. Lastly, don't forget your primary objective in school. Study hard and make good
                grades.
